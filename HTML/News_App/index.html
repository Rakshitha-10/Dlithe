            <p>
               
            
                Good morning. It’s been a week of binary judgments. Should India buy F-35 or Su-57 fighter jets? Did the US Agency for International Development help the Bharatiya Janata party or the opposition? Does Delhi’s new chief minister, Rekha Gupta, bring with her a fresh energy or a lack of experience? Even the headlines sound like Indian news television’s infamous debates now.
            
            From the national to the personal. I was surprised to read this week that among tech-savvy Indians, more income means higher loan repayments. A report on how India spends by PwC and data company Perfios shows the percentage of income spent on loan servicing is largest for high-income earners.
            
            But first, India’s mobile phone exports are growing and Apple’s “Make in India” plan couldn’t have come at a better time.
            
            Dialling up
            India’s smartphone exports have grown nearly 50 per cent in the first 10 months of this fiscal year, and the mobile phone manufacturers’ industry body this week projected that total exports for the year would be Rs1.8tn ($21bn), up from Rs1.3tn in 2023-24. Apple accounts for a significant contribution to this. Taiwanese supplier Foxconn and India’s Tata Electronics have been manufacturing a growing range of Apple products in India. Even the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s most expensive phone, is now made in Tamil Nadu by Foxconn. 
            
            This is significant for both India and Apple. After the introduction of the government’s performance-linked Make in India subsidy scheme, mobile phone production in India has doubled, according to the India Cellular & Electronics Association. Phones have now surpassed diamonds as the country’s biggest export. And although only around 15 per cent of iPhones are currently made in India, this is expected to increase to 25 per cent by 2027, according to JPMorgan and Bank of America analysts. Globally, the company shipped some 232mn iPhones in 2024.
            
            For Apple, this pivot to India is crucial. In the past few years, the company’s dependence on China as a manufacturing location and as a market have created significant challenges. Washington’s growing tensions with Beijing have forced Apple to reduce its overwhelming reliance on Chinese production facilities. And though China remains a top market for its products, the company has been struggling to grow its business there.
            
            Manufacturing in India helps Apple become more competitive in selling in the Indian market too, since it can offer its products at lower price points minus the customs and import duties. But for Apple to really lean into India for a “China plus one” strategy, it has to do a lot more. The iPhones currently made in India are still largely assembled using flown-in parts. The company needs a supply base in India that is as robust as the one in China, and component manufacturers will have to be incentivised to set up shop. 
            
            More importantly, Apple has to do this while trying to figure a way out of the global fatigue of sorts among users of its products. The company has not had a singularly successful cutting-edge new product for several years. Customers are finding fewer reasons to upgrade as each generation of new devices offers only marginal improvement over the previous one. And its biggest software upgrade in recent years, the much-touted integration of artificial intelligence, is limited both in its capability and in reach.
            
            In fact, a few hours before I write this, Apple released its latest offering, the iPhone 16e, a pared down, single-camera offering starting at $599, which too is being sold as a great vehicle for Apple Intelligence, a technology that is yet to arrive even on my fully loaded iPhone Pro in India.

            <p>Air India, India's leading airline, has signed leases and letters of intent for 25 Airbus narrow-body and 5 Boeing wide-body aircraft to augment its existing fleet in the near term.

                These new aircraft, which will enter service from late 2022, will increase the airline’s fleet by over 25%. Not counting the 10 long-grounded narrow-body and 6 wide-body aircraft that have been returned to service in recent months, these new aircraft mark the first major fleet expansion since Air India’sacquisition by the Tata Group earlier this year.
                
                The aircraft being leased include twenty-one Airbus A320neos, four Airbus A321neos and five Boeing B777-200LRs.
                
                The B777-200LRs will join the fleet between December 2022 and March 2023, and will be deployed on routes from Indian metro cities to the United States of America. Mumbai will see the addition of flights to San Francisco as well as to both of the New York area’s international airports, Newark Liberty and John F Kennedy, while Bangalore will receive a 3x weekly service to San Francisco. These aircraft will result in Air India offering Premium Economy haul flights for the first time.
                
                The 4 A321 aircraft are expected to join the Air India fleet in the first quarter of calendar year 2023, while the 21 A320 will be inducted in the second half of 2023. These aircraft will be deployed on domestic sectors as well as to short-haul international destinations.
                
                Commenting on the fleet expansion, Mr. Campbell Wilson, CEO & Managing Director, Air India, said, “After a long time without significant growth, Air India is delighted to resume expanding its fleet and global footprint. These new aircraft, together with existing aircraft being returned to service, address an immediate need for more capacity and connectivity, and mark a strong step forward. Air India has exciting expansion and renewal plans, of which these new aircraft are just the beginning.”
                
                Air India’s narrow-body fleet currently stands at 70 aircraft, of which 54 are in service; the remaining 16 aircraft will progressively return to service by early 2023. Similarly, Air India’s wide-body fleet currently stands at 43 aircraft, of which 33 are operational. The rest will return to service by early 2023</p>

            <p>When the stock market opened for trading today, investors had cues from two central bankers to choose from - world's most powerful Jerome Powell, who runs the US Federal Reserve, and RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das. Ignoring Fed officials' concerns over lack of progress on inflation as revealed in Fed minutes, the bulls chose to focus on the bumper dividend of Rs 2.1 lakh crore announced by the India’s central bank for the government.

                As a result, Sensex jumped over 1,200 points to hit a fresh high above 75,400 while Nifty also rallied 1.64% to come within kissing distance of never-seen-before level of 23,000. Investors were left richer by Rs 4.15 lakh crore as the total market capitalisation of all companies listed on BSE jumped to about Rs 421 lakh crore.
                
                "The higher-than-budgeted RBI surplus transfer would help to boost the government of India's resource envelope in FY2025, allowing for enhanced expenditures or a sharper fiscal consolidation than what was pencilled into the Interim Budget for FY2025. Increasing the funds available for capex would certainly boost the quality of the fiscal deficit," ICRA's chief economist Aditi Nayar said.
                
                In the meantime, investors also took note of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's interview to The Economic Times where he said both BJP and stock market will touch fresh record highs on June 4 when Lok Sabha election results would be declared.

        <label for="news4" class="news-title">Government Reduces LPG Prices to Ease Inflation</label>
        <p class="news-meta">Category: Economy | Published: Aug 20, 2023</p>
        <input type="radio" id="news4" name="news">
        <div class="news-content">
            <img src="news4.jpeg" alt="LPG Prices">
            <p>   The Indian government on Tuesday (August 28) cut the price of a 14 kg LPG cylinder by at least Rs 200. The move is aimed at easing the pressure from rising cost of living due to inflation, ahead of key elections both in the states as well as the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian Parliament) next year.For the Ujjwala scheme beneficiaries, the price drop of an LPG cylinder will be Rs 400 — Rs 200 as price cut and Rs 200 as existing subsidy. For consumers who are not beneficiaries of the Ujjwala scheme, the price cut will be by Rs 200 only. The price cut is effective from August 30.


                The government said it will give 75 lakh new gas connections for free in a bid to clear applications related to Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). With these new connections, the number of PMUY beneficiaries will increase to 10.35 crore.
                
                
                Terming it as a gift to crores of women on Raksha Bandhan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "Our government will always do everything possible that improves people's quality of life and benefits the poor and middle class."
                
                
                Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, "We understand the challenges faced by households in managing their budgets. The reduction in cooking gas prices is aimed at providing direct relief to families and individuals, while also supporting government's larger goal of ensuring affordable access to essential items."
                
                
                Currently, a domestic LPG cylinder costs Rs 1,053 in Delhi, Rs 1,052.50 in Mumbai, Rs 1,068.50 in Chennai and Rs 1,079 in Kolkata. The oil marketing companies increased the price of domestic LPG cylinder by Rs 50 in July. Earlier, the prices were increased twice in May.
                
                
                The move comes ahead of Assembly polls in five states — Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Mizoram — scheduled for later this year. The Narendra Modi administration's current five-year term at the Centre too comes to an end next year.
                
                
                Earlier, CNBC-TV18 had reported that the government of India is planning fresh measures to woo voters ahead of the elections. The cut in LPG prices may help in easing household expenses. Inflation in India had hit a 15-month high of 7.44 percent in July 2023, largely due to a spike in food prices.    </p>
